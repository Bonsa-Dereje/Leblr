    <h1 class="afacad"> What is Leblr ?</h1>
    <p class = "afacad">Leblr is an all-in-one, 
        AI-powered media workflow platform 
        designed for churches, ministries, 
        and sermon-driven content creators. 
        Whether you’re capturing footage on
         a phone, syncing audio in the booth, 
         editing in Premiere Pro, or posting to 
         social media — Leblr streamlines the 
         entire process, helping you focus more
          on the message and less on the mechanics.</p>

            <p class = "sldContent">
               Mark powerful sermon moments as 
               they happen. Flags emotional 
               or high-engagement segments so you 
               can turn them into reels instantly.
